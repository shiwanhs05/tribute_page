  scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu

  mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
  intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be
  known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
  technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
  nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
